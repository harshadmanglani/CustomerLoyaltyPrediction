# Customer Loyalty Prediction

This project contains the source code for an artificial neural network trained on a real world dataset from a bank, with the following features:
1. CustomerID
2. Surname
3. CreditScore
4. Geography
5. Gender
6. Age
7. Tenure
8. Balance
9. NumofProducts
10. HasCrCard
11. IsActiveMember
12. EstimatedSalary
13. Exited

The task was to identify which customers may leave the bank in the future, based on this current data. While we can observe that features 1 & 2 are of no use, features 4 & 5 could be useful in determining the same. The rest are definitely features
that contribute to a customer's loyalty to the bank.

Based on the results, including features 4 & 5 did give a better accuracy.
